This is the readme file for our final project draft program 

    
    A draft consists of rounds and each round has a number of picks: one for each team.  
    Each pick consists of a the full name of a player that the team would like to draft.  
    The draft you implement should have 25 rounds and there should be five teams participating in the draft.  You can hardcode the team names as Team1, Team2, Team3, Team4, and Team5.  
    The pick order for the first round should be Team1, Team2, Team3, Team4, and Team5.  Each round after the first the pick order should reverse.  For example, the order for round two should be Team5, Team4, Team3, Team2, and Team1, and the order for round three should be Team1, Team2, Team3, Team4, and Team5 again.
    The application needs to keep track of what round it is and who has the next pick.
    The manager of each team must create an account and login to make their picks.

Your application should consist of two models: a User model and a Pick model.  A User should have many Picks and a Pick should belong to just one user.

The user interface might look something like this:
Round 	Pick 	User 	Team 	Player
1 	1 	Mark 	Team 1 	Sally Smith
1 	2 	Jane 	Team 2 	John Doe

 

This is a group project and it is due at midnight on 12/18.  Please submit a URL to the Git hub repository that contains your application.

Have fun!
